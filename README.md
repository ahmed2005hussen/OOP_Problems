# **Simple C++ Projects Collection ðŸŒŸ**

This repository contains three interesting and educational C++ projects, each showcasing specific programming concepts and techniques. The projects include **MySet**, **Label Generation**, and **Game of Life**.

## **1. MySet**  
A custom implementation of a set-like data structure, demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts in C++.

### **Features**  
- Implements a `MySet` class with functionalities such as:  
  - Adding elements.  
  - Removing elements.  
  - Printing the set.  
- Ensures unique elements are maintained in the set.  

### **How to Use**  
1. Run the program.  
2. Use the menu options to:  
   - Add elements to the set.  
   - Remove specific elements.  
   - View the current state of the set.  
3. Exit when done.  

### **Key Learning Points**  
- Class and object usage in C++.  
- Managing dynamic arrays and ensuring data uniqueness.

## **2. Label Generation**  
A program that dynamically generates unique labels for tasks or objects using a systematic approach.

### **Features**  
- Uses a sequence of alphanumeric labels for identification.  
- Automatically updates and maintains label uniqueness.  
- Simple interface for generating and viewing labels.  

### **How to Use**  
1. Run the program.  
2. Generate labels using the provided menu.  
3. View or reset labels as needed.  

### **Key Learning Points**  
- Handling strings and character operations.  
- Automating label generation with algorithms.  
- Working with sequences and ensuring consistency.

## **3. Game of Life**  
An implementation of Conway's *Game of Life*, a cellular automaton showcasing simulation programming.

### **Features**  
- A 30x30 grid where cells evolve based on predefined rules.  
- Allows users to activate cells by entering their indices.  
- Simulates grid evolution in real-time with visual updates.  

### **Rules**  
1. **For a live cell (`*`)**:  
   - Dies if it has fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors.  
   - Survives if it has exactly 2 or 3 neighbors.  
2. **For a dead cell (` `)**:  
   - Becomes alive if it has exactly 3 neighbors.  

### **How to Use**  
1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the index of cells (0-899) to activate them or `-1` to start the simulation.  
3. Watch the grid evolve with a delay between generations.  

### **Key Learning Points**  
- Multi-dimensional arrays and neighbor-checking algorithms.  
- Real-time simulation using loops and delay functions.  
- Modular design for complex logic.
